bubble-operator-upwards is a function that "bubbles an operator
upwards" in a form, demultiplexing all alternative branches by way of
cartesian product. This operation is notably useful for easy
implementation of certain kinds of shorthand notations in macros. A
cartesian-product function is also exported, as it's inherently needed
to implement the main function.
